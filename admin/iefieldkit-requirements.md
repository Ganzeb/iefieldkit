# iefieldkit - requirements

This file lists the requirements that all commands in `iefieldkit` should be developed for.

# Stata version
* At least version 13.0

# Code dependencies
* No `iefieldkit` command should be developed in a way that it does not need any other command to be installed. Other commands in the `iefieldkit` are excluded from this rule and an `iefieldkit` may depend on another `iefieldkit` command.
