### Description

iefieldkit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of primary data collection. Some of these commands are written for data collection using opendatakit.org (specifically surveycto.com) but the commands are developed to be possible to use in many other contexts as well. See https://github.com/worldbank/iefieldkit for more details. These commands are developed by the World Bank's unit for impact evaluations (DIME).
