# SSC Meta Description
See instructions for the content in this file here: http://repec.org/bocode/s/sscsubmit.html

This is the information that will show when typing `ssc describe iefieldkit` and on the ideas.repec.org page that will be created once we publish the first version.

Compare with `ssc describe ietoolkit` and https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458137.html

### What are keywords?
This is an explanation to the keywords used below. I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.

### Description

iefieldkit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of primary data collection. The package is developed to facilitate a work flow including (1) data collection (in particular using opendatakit.org, more specifically surveycto.com); (2) basic data cleaning, such as labelling and recoding; (3) reconciling survey rounds; (4) preparing codebooks to document data sets. The commands can also be used independently, and are developed to be applicable to many other contexts as well. See https://github.com/worldbank/iefieldkit for more details. These commands are developed by the World Bank's unit for impact evaluations (DIME).
