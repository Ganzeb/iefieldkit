### Description

iefieldkit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of primary data collection. Some of these commands are written for data collection using opendatakit.org (specifically surveycto.com) but the commands are developed to be possible to use in many other contexts as well. See https://github.com/worldbank/iefieldkit for more details. These commands are developed by the World Bank's unit for impact evaluations (DIME).

### Keywords
I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.
